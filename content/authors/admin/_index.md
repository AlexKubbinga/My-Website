I am Dutch and South African, but spent the majority of my life growing up in Dubai. Currently pursuing a masters in analytics and management to further develop my technical and business skillsets. My interests include investing, data analysis, technology and health & fitness. At LBS I am a member of the Investment Management Club, Football Club, Tech & Media Club, and the Energy & Environment Club.
